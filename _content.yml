Awarded $80k to operationalize these models to increase data processing efficiency by up to 50%, reduce manual processing time by up to 90%, and save over $0.5M annually.
        * Leading a 3-year $768k collaborative initiative across five Divisions to bridge scientists, data users, and IT to modernize SEFSC data infrastructure and address bottlenecks through consolidation and data warehousing strategies aligned with FAIR data principles and data governance best practices (competitive funding award).
        * Collaborating across six regional Science Centers to replace siloed data management practices with national solutions to common problems, streamline data pipelines, and minimize duplicated technological efforts. Stood up GCP cloud-based high-performance video analysis system to scale up data processing capabilities of 30 TB (1000 hrs) of annual underwater survey video data. Stood up cloud storage to enable public data access (GCP).
        * Leading Center-wide initiative to encourage innovation by documenting and implementing best practices (*e.g.*, data governance), championing open science (*e.g.*, GitHub, Quarto, Jupyter notebooks), and providing technical expertise and training in Python and machine learning.

      details: |
        * Developed and documented a cloud-optimized on-demand data pipeline in AWS, reducing the data ingest-to-archive timeline from months to minutes. Demonstrated to Leadership cost, computation, and scalability benefits of cloud computing for data processing and storage by comparing lift-and-shift to refactored cloud migration methods and netCDF to Zarr data formats.
        * Established a collaborative relationship between NCEI, another NOAA program office, and external partners to resolve long-standing data archival issues by leading the implementation of metadata standardization and controlled vocabularies. Implemented the archival of delayed-mode ocean glider data for the first time, increasing public access to glider data by several-fold.
        * Collaborated with the Navy to define metadata requirements for uncrewed systems platforms and develop joint metadata standards for data collection and dissemination leading to the development of a joint NOAA-Navy metadata schema to bolster data interoperability and streamline data sharing within the federal government.
        * Served as NOAA federal representative and subject matter expert to Gulf Blue Navigator cohort of late-stage startup companies supporting the blue tech economy along the U.S. Gulf Coast.
    - details: |
