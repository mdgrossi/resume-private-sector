# Professional resume of Matt Grossi
### Oceanographer | Data Scientist

This repository contains my professional private sector r&#232;sum&#232; rendered in both `pdf` and `html` formats.

The `pdf` version is a custom Quarto implementation of the LaTeX [moderncv](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) template. The implementation is derived from the [modern2-cv](https://github.com/schochastics/modern-cv) template by [schochastics](https://github.com/schochastics). It is by no means a full implementation of this template; not even close. It only implements the features and customizations I needed for my particular project.

The `html` rendering supports integeration with my [portfolio website](https://mdgrossi.github.io). It is heavily inspired by and based upon this [quarto-resume](https://github.com/busemorose/resume_quarto) by user [busemorose](https://github.com/busemorose).

Credit and kudos to both authors, as well as all upstream template authors, none of whom I know personally. Thank you for your contributions to [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).

To pay it forward, I have[^1] **templated my implementation** as well. If you wish to replicate this implementation, with or without your own formatting modifications, please fork or clone **the template repo** instead of this repo containing my personal r&#232;sum&#232;.

[^1]: Or will. Very soon. Promise.
